[tab title="Machine Learning"]
<div><strong>ETL project, Egyptian Army</strong>, 2003:</div>
<div>Data Extract Transform and Load (ETL) project for 3 months. Extract data from an Informix database on an old Sun server. Transform and clean the data. Load the data into Oracle/Windows server.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Decision Support System</strong>, Egyptian Army, 2003:</div>
<div>Data-driven DSS system that used data analytics and machine learning to help strategic planning for the Egyptian Army. Tools included C#, Oracle Forms, and Oracle DB.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Intelligent Marketing campaign planning system</strong>, Novartis, Egypt, 2004</div>
<div>A data-driven campaign planning system that creates a nationwide campaign plan and individual salesmen schedule. The system used graph algorithms to solve for the optimal schedule (minimum campaign cost) plus maximizing expected revenue subjected to plenty of constraints such as marketing visit frequency per client class, different preferred visit time per client, preferred work hours per salesman, already scheduled client-salesman visits. Built entirely in Oracle PL/SQL.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Real-time facial expression recognition</strong>, Virginia Tech, 2013
Real-time facial expression recognition system that reads RGB-D data from a Kinect camera. Many tools and techniques have been used such as Dimensionality reduction using PCA, Linear and nonlinear SVM. 3D point cloud triangulation. The system has been prototyped using Matlab and built for real-time operation using C# that calls a C++ implementation of SVM.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Handwriting analysis</strong>, Virginia Tech, 2014</div>
<div>
<div>Gender Identification from handwriting model that used SVM to identify the writer gender from a scanned handwritten document. Many features have been experimented with including chain coding features, and a novel wavelet-based LBP features. In this project, Python, Matlab has been used to write all the code. Best poster presentation award has been given to this work during the ICIP conference in London, UK</div>
</div>

<div><strong>Sufficiency server admin</strong>, Virginia Tech, 2015 till now</div>
<div>
<div>Manage the lab Centos server. Install Software packages that included deep learning packages such as Caffe. Help other students to use the server.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Text detection in natural scenes using Deep Learning</strong>, Virginia Tech, 2015 till now</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>My main Ph.D. work that involved building deep learning models to detect text instances in natural scene images. I used Caffe for 1 year then moved to Torch for a short period of time,Â then, currently Keras/Tensorflow (I always write my code to be compatible with both TF and Theano). I had 3 publications plus a 4th one under review now at NIPS (a 4096 layers model with a trick to fight the vanishing gradient problem) also, prior to my graduation in Dec., I am planning to submit to CVPR (deadline this Nov.). I am using Virginia Tech clusters that are Centos machine with K80 GPUs and recently P100 GPUs.</div>
